The most reductionist view of a plot is: Equilibrium > Disturbance > Equilibrium.
If you want to use a subsidy publisher, I would just use common sense.
The iPad is pretty good, but I would suggest getting a USB keyboard as well.
I think the best way to remind someone is "I think my e-mail missed your attention".
First, limit the number of people you solicit for feedback.
Take a look at the work of Robert J. Sawyer and Terry Goodkind.
I've been using Scrivener, which is available as a free beta for NaNoWriMo participants.
At first, I thought this is a bit of a tricky question.

I noticed you said "movie critics" enjoy mythological references in a film, but do audiences?
You've got the seeds of your answer in your edit.
You can self-publish your book as an e-book using Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, and it doesn't cost a penny.
The best way to write any novel (or story)is to write it as if it is a standalone.
It's pretty readable as is (aside from a few grammatical errors in the dialogues that may be intentional) - not boring.
The standard initial market for a short story is a literary magazine.

I used to work on a project where we wrote a graphical UI to subversion for a group of artists.
If I'm writing something in a plaintext format, like LaTeX or HTML, I'll generally use version control.
David Weber's The War God's Own has some lengthy travel scenes in it which he does quite well.
Describe first whatever will pull the reader into the scene.
I think Stephen King's comments are helpful in this regard.
Not enough points to add to Lauren Ipsum's answer, but I really do like Scrivener.
While an answer has already been selected, I wanted to add some further points.
When I'm writing well, I don't think deliberately about MRUs.
Just because a setting is made up doesn't mean it's fantasy.
Edit: Wikipedia knows how to explain it better than I do.
It depends on what your blog is trying to achieve.
I agree with Kate Sherwood, you should be able to attribute most quotes these days by simple fact checking.
Here's a technique that can help: Identify each instance of he saw or he heard or he thought.
Am I allowed to beat the drum for Scrivener again?
1) Does the story have to be from the POV of the necromancer?
You can try a Business Writing textbook, looking through the most promising sections.
I would suggest some of the pickup artist material that has been written over the past five years.
Call me boring, but, at least for now, I only disobey the chronological order for historical-based interludes.
Rather than "deployed": helped to launch I've no idea what an "enterprise application" is, so perhaps that could be rephrased.
