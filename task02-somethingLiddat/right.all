- British Labour members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcome the welcomed contribution to the continuous work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without fully adhere to all the details of it.

Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive provisions. This is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.
If we define a clear framework and constraining for the Member States, the various systems having to satisfy these requirements should have more a long period of setting with the test.

It is gratifying that Parliament has managed to gather a large majority in favour of greater transparency.
For this cooperation, for your support and also for your welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European institutions, the French Presidency thank you.

Finally, I welcome the idea of giving us an annual meeting in order to take stock of the implementation of the programme.
Nevertheless, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that most of this money is managed in the Member States.

Mr President, we cannot know the position of the Commission in the matter of public access to documents in reading the Commission has that has been postponed, on 11 October, the officials of the Commission in order to explain the way in which they had to deal with the requests in this regard access to documents.
If we define a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the different systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period of being tested.
A development which made capital borrowed heavily dependent.
That is why I also believe that this reconciliation can take, and the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the issue of universities and many other problems, needs visible signs of success and a strong support, otherwise the peace threatened in the region as a whole.
This is what we have done: we have a budget crisis in coming to Article 272; the financial perspectives have been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.

They will continue to put pressure. The money they earn with the distribution beyond the limit of 150 grammes enables them to strengthen their position.
I wonder whether the police chief envisages already stages which will make it possible to show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of Serbian people and as the partner with whom the European Union will have henceforth to treat.
It is urgent and it is for that reason that we have decided to put this item on the agenda.
The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been voted, does not reflect it.
Madam President, I would ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany Marín, that the city of Galicia, which are from most of the victims.

The annual report is to identify such potential improvements.
You do not want to even integrate it in the Treaty, which proves that this text was to be put on side.
This is our priority for the affirmation of fundamental rights to be implemented in political choices.
Let us, here in order to be able to welcome in good conditions the countries that are knocking at our door.
Either we are part of the club, we are not and we must, therefore, we have to comply with this.
I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides for steps to show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union must now address.
We have started to have exchanges on this issue, it emerges that all the Member States wish to the maintenance of this ceiling after enlargement.
They continue to put the pressure that they earn. money with the distribution of the limit of 150 grammes allows them to strengthen their position.
Since the first thoughts on this issue, which were held at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to Member States to promote an action intended to develop what we could consider a European police culture, focused on the highest standards in terms of ethics, human rights and freedoms, and efficiency in the fight against crime.
Since the first reflexions on this file, which took place at the European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission committed itself with respect to the Member States promoting an action intended to develop what we could regard as a European police culture, centered on the highest standards as regards deontology, of respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens, and of effectiveness in the fight against crime.

Lastly, and it is there a subject more discussed, the commission invited with strength to make use of the procedure accelerated to put in uvre this legislation.
The safeguarding of the universal service with compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably failure.
This Parliament has, however, also for this Fund actions by the use of framework, defined in a statement on the financial perspective.

(The Parliament accepts the oral amendment)
In addition, we would like to be likely to prove in Europe which we are able to develop only the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, by recognizing the true democratic principles.
And I would say to you very clearly: it must be given a chance to Kostunica, and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty over the coming weeks or months; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, in political terms and in budgetary terms, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.
A budget line has programmes to de-mining and prevention for years.
We congratulate the provisions proposed in this respect by the Committee and by the general Assembly of the United Nations with regard to the method of non-governmental organisations, and the extraordinary session of September 2001.
I find exemplary that France has resolved to take that step.
By withdrawing our resolution, I am nonetheless convinced that our Parliament would have done better in devoting its voice to the Nice European Council, a specific resolution and separate issues so important and so difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than to deal with them in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council.
In 1996, the European Parliament was in favour of a ban on the use of meat meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had listened to.

Without doubt, just better to have no agreement than having an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the US proposal was a watered-down proposal, which is totally unacceptable for Europe.
It is allowed that the knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition with mobility.
In my view, there is, however, nothing worse than to have to warn the people a ruling in their favour could be a series of reassuring words and have no concrete result on their existence.
Either we belong to the club, or we are not and we must therefore be packed with this decision.
The preservation of the universal service with a compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private benefits for the benefit of the public service will probably long fire.
. The British Labour Members of the PSE Group welcomes the support given to the contribution to the work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhere entirely with all the details of this.
Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, that I find well thought-out and clearly formulated.
We should be pleased that Parliament has succeeded in bringing together a large majority in favour of greater transparency.
A development which made them dependent on the borrowed capital.
A budget line has programmes for mine clearance and prevention for years.
Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive measures, and that is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.
This is the position defended by the rapporteur and by the popular Party.
My Party to serious and about the rules of the sale of consumer products by means of the Community, just as it sets about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
A development which made highly dependent on capital borrowed.
It is necessary to be delighted that the Parliament succeeded in gathering a broad majority in favour of a greater transparency.
In view of the criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it is now a tax for all users, including the British lorry drivers.

All those who are currently working on the black market to obtain an employment in decent social conditions.
In addition, we would like to have a chance to prove to the Europe that we are in a position to alone the cause of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, while recognizing the principles.

Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the different countries and for the EU as a whole - depends on the example of Denmark is for us to show - largely of the elimination of social and democratic deficits in European policy.
Mr. President, we can know the position of the Commission as regards access to public documents by reading the internal handbook which was given, on October 11, with the Commission officials in order to explain the way to them in which they were to treat the requests emanating of the deputies with regard to the access to the documents.
It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs persists in refusing a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.
The maintenance of the universal service means of a compensation fund which could initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably deal fire.
Thirdly: the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the EU as a whole depend - the example of Denmark is here to show this - largely to the elimination of social and democratic deficits in European policy.
Mr. President, the Committee on Citizens and of the rights of citizens, justice and the businesses interiors prepared with much care the Karamanou report/ratio.
The recent incidents against the Greek imperative more the need to promote measures, of strengthening the institutions and the respect of human rights in Albania.
In my eyes, there is however nothing worse than to have to inform people that a judgment delivered in their favour could be only one series of comforting words and not to have any practical consequence on their existence.
In withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that our Parliament would have made its voice heard in dedicating, in view of the Nice Council, a resolution and traditional so important and so difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than to deal in the framework of a single resolution including also all the other points of the agenda of the Council.
I have already replied on this point, and I entirely agree with what he has said about the need to improve considerably the public debate. I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often, citizens feel alienated to decisions that are taken in the bodies that they do not know.
These weeks, three important have been achieved.
For this co-operation, for your support and also for your reception, Madam the President, Mesdames and the European Deputies, the French presidency thanks you.
Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière, report that I find well and clearly.
Greek ships ran, without there being the least storm in trimmings, Mr Gayssot.
The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara more imperative the need to promote measures of democratisation, strengthening of the institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
Since the first thoughts on this issue, which took place at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to the Member States to promote action to develop what we might regard as a European police culture, based on the highest standards in the field of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the citizens, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.
Let us organise ourselves in fifteen in order to be able to welcome in the countries that are knocking at our door.
That is the position advocated by the rapporteur and supported by the European People's Party.
It should be delighted that the Parliament together a broad majority in favour of greater transparency.
It is accepted that knowledge of foreign languages is a necessary precondition to mobility.
I find it a little strange to want as of now forcing the Commission to a motion for a resolution and to ask him at the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and supplementary sickness insurance.
However, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of GDP of the Member States and that most of this money is managed in the Member States.
Furthermore, we would like to be able to demonstrate in Europe which we are able to develop only the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, recognising the true democratic principles.
Indeed, it is absolutely not certain only the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the various definitions used currently in the Member States are enough all amply.
The right to a government to remove arbitrarily its Constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.
I have also voted against a text that calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty to be adopted in Nice.
Things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive measures, which is particularly on this point that we have tabled amendments.
Do you think that the “Austrian” model - namely decision making majority bilateral - will in the future constitute an instrument making it possible to make decisions by being unaware of the European institutions and to found a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity within the Council?
The safeguard of the universal service using compensation funds which would make it possible to engage of the private profits to the profit of the public service will probably make failure.
Thirdly: the approval of the enlargement and its positive prospects for the different countries and for the EU as a whole and - the example of Denmark is for us to the point - matters of the social and economic policy.
It is a shame when they believe that the European Union presents itself as the champion of the modernisation of the life!
My Party expresses serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods by means of Community legislation, as it makes reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues of the Commission and on my own behalf, to send a message from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both of city of Galicia, where they are in the majority of victims.
I urge that to seize this motion, this invitation, this request of dialogue, to give further and to make sure that, together with this Assembly, these relics of a nationalist might be.
Ships Greeks have sunk, without that there are the slightest storm in the exist, Mr Gayssot.
The common economic activities create peaceful bonds between the people.
Secondly, it is necessary to say "no" to the concept to accept at the same time an important Group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.
Let us can organize itself to Fifteen in order to be able to accomodate under right conditions the countries which strike with our door.
The annual report aims to identify potential such improvements.
This is our struggle for priority that the affirmation of fundamental rights to be implemented in political choices.
I have also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future Treaty which will be adopted in Nice.
Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which bang would admit that at the same time an important group of countries, because that would be at odds with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.
. The British Labour Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the support given to the contribution they have made to the work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of it.
On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies fall into force by the further restriction of the right of veto and to increasing the power of Parliament to the EU.
The resolution about the Summit of Nice, which has just been voted, does not reflect it.
This is not the time to show.
Initially, that of a simplification and a clarification of the Treaties.
We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.
On the contrary, the power of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.
(it) the British labour Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very welcome to the contribution that they have continuous work of the IGC on the cooperation, without all the details of this.
Spain developed in a remarkably positive way the difficult vicinity which always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.
Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept bang who would like to see the same time admit a large group of countries, because that would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.
There is, of course, a very important point, it is the fact that we started the heading four, with its approach, but we do not know yet very well if we managed to solve the problem, in particular because the Council does not wish to take part sufficiently in the reflexion.
In Nigeria, encouraging the violence in their employment and go up to pay soldiers to draw on the demonstrators at the basis of warri.
The European Council will discuss also of the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore, of enlargement.
I thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.
I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this context, it is not or cannot be competitive without borders.
We can, in fact, want more and better, but I believe that it is a good start.
It is rightly that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights persists in the rejection of a ceiling and in the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be below 7%.
We have started to have discussions on this issue, which show that all the Member States want to keep the ceiling after enlargement.
We have started to have trade on this issue, where it appears that all Member States wish to maintain this ceiling after enlargement.
I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides steps which will make it possible to show that we regard Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with whom the European Union will now have to deal with.
The other point of view, illustrated by the rapporteur's original and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the rules and codes of conduct needed to build, between insurers, forms of degree of costs guaranteeing all the supply of good quality care and to counter the risks of discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.
Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite course and we cannot approve it.
Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the whole of the EU depend - the example of Denmark is here to show this - largely to the elimination of social and democratic deficits of European policy.
Slovakia is not doomed to remain in the second group, and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.
I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.
Finally, and this is a most controversial issue, the Commission has called vigorously to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.
Mr. President, I have voting in favour of the report García-Margallo there Marfil, which relates to the tax on the abundant services with electronic way.
Either we part of the club, or we are not, and we must therefore we bow to this decision.
On the situation in Burma.
The other point of view, illustrated by the example of the original rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct needed to create, between insurers, the forms of mutual costs guaranteeing to all the provision of high-quality care and to counter the risk of seeing develop discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.
The task, which is important, however, did not arouse great interest on the part of the public yet.
The lesson must retain this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are in the world, in a state of mess, and that we must get down to the task of up.
It is a shame when it is thought that the European Union is posed as a champion modernization of the economic life!
And I say this very clearly: it is necessary to give its chance to Kostunica and I hope that it will take time to a clear in the course of the coming weeks or months; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, in terms of policy and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely the and reconstruction.
Furthermore, we would have a chance to demonstrate to Europe that we are in a position to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro, in Yugoslavia, recognising the real democratic principles.
If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene with money and concrete actions, and not only with words.
I am a bit of him now to compel the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him in a time to establish a Green Paper on the current State of voluntary insurance and health insurance.
There is, of course, a very important point, is the fact that we have initiated within category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, not least because the Council does not wish to participate enough food for thought.
A development which has made heavily dependent on capital loans.
Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that she wants to adhere to the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.
question nº 6 of (H-0886/00):
In my view, there is nothing worse than having to warn people that a judgment in their favour could only be a series of reassuring words and have no practical effect on their existence.
Firstly, that of a simplification and clarification of the Treaties.
If employment is the political priority of the Union, fishing, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.
We have heard that the previous presidency has first restructured and then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.
It is necessary to know today, since we are still in the uncertainty, which are the scientific, what are the measures to take.
I insist on this point because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this perspective, there is neither can be no competition without limits.
They will continue to put the pressure. The money that they gain with the distribution beyond the limit of the 150 grams makes it possible them to reinforce their position.
I also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted at Nice.
If we define a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems to meet these demands should have a longer period of put to the test.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that we shall, of course, be voting.
Question 6 (H-0886 / 00):
That is our fight priority for the affirmation of fundamental rights is implemented in political choices.
As the Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also a solid experience regarding such forms of control; we can take to basis.
As the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, they initiatives the European Council Presidency intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?
There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have begun category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, not least because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.
If we want to help Indonesia, we must act now with money and concrete action, and not only with words.
Firstly, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.
This rule can apply to all drugs récréationnelles provided that the consumer but dangerous drugs is the only to run risks.
Unfortunately the ultimate goal of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and, of course, we cannot approve it.
Everyone who works are currently obtiendraient undeclared work in decent social conditions.
Do you think the Austrian model '' - namely the bilateral majority decision-making - will in future an instrument to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to set up a new institution, or a new group, in order to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?
The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months ago, does not properly to trace the origin of animals and we have banned rather belatedly specified risk material.
Do you believe that the 'Austrian model' - namely the taking of bilateral majority decisions - in the future will be an instrument for taking decisions ignoring the European institutions and to build a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity in the Council?
Either we belong to the club, or let us not be we and we thus should be folded with this decision.
I stress this because the market cannot solve all and that, accordingly, there is not and cannot have competition without limits.
As the European Parliament has called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that they initiatives will the presidency of the European Council intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?
Nevertheless, I would like to say to the idea that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union does not believe that 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the bulk of this money is managed in the Member States.
In recent weeks, three major progress has been made.
It is a disgrace when it is believed that the European Union has set itself up as a champion modernisation of economic life.
Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, which I think is well thought-out and clearly formulated.
Above all, when a company or unipersonnelle a society relying less than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to receive funding not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the simple basis of a good idea.
It must be the true brain coordination of the network of national agencies, which in turn will activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence food safety at regional level.
I would also that the report of the Court of Auditors was that it had some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.
The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been voted, do not reflect.
Since the first thoughts on this issue, which took place at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission committed itself in relation to the Member States to promote an action intended to develop what we could describe as a European Commissioner culture, based on the highest standards of ethics, respect for human rights and freedoms, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.
Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany that Marín, city of Galicia, where are from most of the victims.
I stress this because the market cannot solve all and that, in this sense, there is no cannot be competitive without limits.
Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.
Mr President, the Committee on citizens' freedoms and rights, justice and internal Affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report.
In 1996, the European Parliament has voted in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had listened to.
Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and we are to retain any prepared very carefully the Karamanou report.
The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the favourable reception reserved for the contribution they have made to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation, without endorsing totally at all the details of this.
A budget line, programmes and of many years.
Finally, and this is a controversial issue, the Commission has called with force to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.
I find it a little strange to try to now force the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him in a same time to establish a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and health insurance complementary.
(B5-0794 / 2000 by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnapping of a Spanish sophistry in Colombia engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;
Since 1996, the European Parliament decided in favour of a ban on the use of meat meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only we had been listened to.
Finally I welcome the idea of us to give an annual assessment of the implementation of the programme.
I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides for steps to show that we consider Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union will now have to deal with.
By withdrawing our resolution, I nevertheless expresses the conviction that our Parliament would have done better its voice heard in devoting, in view of the Nice European Council, a specific and separate resolution to the issues so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than dealt with in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda for the Council.
This is a development of the kind that I wish the other States of the European Union.
The only case for which no tax is still seen is that of a provision in the European Community from a third country.
I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take this step.
Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and to the local authorities of both Brittany and of Marín, city of Galicia, which is from the majority of the victims.
These objectives, the primary objective and the secondary objectives, will represent the stone of hitting enabling us to judge the concrete proposals presented by the Commission.
On the contrary, the power of the national democracies is increasingly to restrict the right of veto and of giving Parliament more power for the EU.
My party issues serious reservations in connection with the regulation of the sales of products of consumption by the means of the community legislation, just like it issues reserves in connection with the concept of mutual recognition of the standards.
I find that France exemplary committed itself to take this step.
It is, of course, a very important point, it is the fact that we have the section four, with its approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, in particular because the Council does not wish to participate enough.
And let me make it very clear: it is necessary to give its chance Kostunica, and I therefore hope that it will ensure an amnesty in the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I wish, however, that, politically, and the budgetary level, the political conditions be coupled with the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.
It is rightly that the Legal Committee persists in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be lower than 7%.
Mr. President, I will concentrate in my intervention on the report/ratio of Mrs. Lalumière, report/ratio which I find formulated well conceived and clearly.
I find exemplary that France determined itself to cross this step.
For this cooperation, for your support and also for your warm welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the French Presidency thank you.
The situation is worsening, when it comes to women distant countries who have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to meet their basic needs.
In the debate is closed.
It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs continues in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.
(The sitting was suspended at 14h06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara make more imperative the need to promote democratisation measures, of institution building and respect for the rights of the man in Albania.
The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the favourable response given to the contribution they have made to the continuing work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of this.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the García-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided by electronic means.
The statements must be followed up by practical actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
Do you think that the ‘ Austrian 'model – namely decision-making majority bilateral - will in future be an instrument for making it possible to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to establish a new institution, or a new group, to be able to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?
When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to put the precautionary principle into practice.
It is our priority for the assertion of fundamental rights is in political choices.
We heard that the previous presidency initially restructured then dismantled the ministry for the equal opportunity.
This rule can also apply to all drugs rÃ©crÃ©ationnelles but dangerous, provided that the consumer of drugs is the only one to run risks.
It is our priority combat so that the assertion of fundamental rights is concretized in political choices.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the García-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided by way.
I thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.
Finally, I welcome the idea of giving an annual meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme.
Especially, when a unipersonal company or a company less cash than 250 paid has a project, it must be possible to be given a financing not only with one guarantee with 120%, but also on the simple basis of an good idea.
If employment is the priority Union policy, fishing, as an economic sector, cannot remain in margin.
You do not want in the Treaty, which shows that this text must be put aside.
In fact, it is not absolutely certain that the definition of price that is proposed is better than another, because the different currently in the Member States all fully.
I have already said on this point and I fully endorse what he said on the need to improve the public debate considerably I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that, all too often the citizens feel alienated by decisions taken in authorities that they do not know.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
There is urgency and that is why we have decided to put this issue on the agenda.
The lesson for us within this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the laws at sea are, in the world, in a state of chaos, and that we must get down to work to bring order.
Either we are part of the club, or we are not and we must therefore we abide by this decision.
The right to a government to remove arbitrarily its constitution is defining characteristic of a tyranny.
Indeed, it is not at all convinced that the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the different definitions used in the Member States are sufficient all amply.
The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which entered into force for two and a half months, does not allow for properly tracing the origin of animals, and we have belatedly banned specified risk material.
It happening in trial on 8 January. he is accused of taking part in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, what to do deny it.
When we are confronted with a potential risk, it is important to put the precautionary principle into practice.
Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):
In 1996, the European Parliament is in favour of a ban on the use in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only they had.
An evolution which made them strongly dependent on the borrowed capital.
Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and internal affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report.
The debate is closed.
I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty, which will be adopted in Nice.
You do not even want to incorporate it into the Treaty, which shows that this text was to be put to one side.
As the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that these initiatives is the Presidency of the European Council intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN Peace Plan?
All those which currently work with the black would obtain an employment under decent social conditions.
We need to know today, since we are always in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.
- (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united Europe.
There is urgency and therefore we decided to put this point at the order of business.
The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been passed, does not reflect the.
This Parliament has, however, also fought for this reduction in the funds allocated to the innovative actions should be compensated for by the use of flexible framework, set out in a statement on the financial perspective.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting.
Faced with criticisms, particularly those of Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it is now a matter of resources for all users, including the drivers of heavy goods vehicles.
It crosses the 8 January of this year. it is to have a Union of Tunisian opponents in France, which Moreover it.
If we create a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the various systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period test.
And I say to you very clearly: we need to give its opportunity to Koitunica, and I therefore hope that he will ensure an amnesty over the coming weeks or months; but meanwhile, I hope, however, that, in political terms and in budgetary terms, political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.
The annual report is designed to identify such potential improvements.
It is urgent and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.
We can actually want more and better, but I think quite honestly that it is a good start.
